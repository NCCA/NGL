#NGL the NCCA Graphics Library
This is the main source branch for the NCCA Graphics Library ngl.

It needs to be built using QtCreator and you will also need to install
boost

For more info check out the website here

http://nccastaff.bmth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/
and for the demos 

http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/index.html

Theres are also other demos on github which are generally work in progress.
#Demos

![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/SimpleNGL.png)

This is the most basic version of an NGL demo, it creates a simple window in Qt and allows
the manipulaiton of the teapot using the mouse.

##[SDLNGL](https://github.com/NCCA/SDLNGL)
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/SDLNGL.png)

This is the simplest SDL / NGL demo using a basic SDL2.0 window and core profile OpenGL context

As the ngl::Text class is reliant upon QFont at present this class is a drop in replacment using  [sdl-ttf] (https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
eventually all of this will be merged into the core ngl with compile time flags to choose the text rendering engine.

For a detailed look at how this work see the following blog posts

[The Initial Design](http://jonmacey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/sponza-demo-pt-1-initial-design.html)

[The mtl Class](http://jonmacey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/sponza-demo-pt-2-mtl-class.html)
