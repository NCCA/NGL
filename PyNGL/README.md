# NGL Python bindings

Add the path $HOME/NGL/lib to you PYTHONPATH to use these. At present most types work and aprox 90% of code is compatible. 

## Issues

At present the VertexArrayObject classes SimpleVAO, MultiBufferVAO, SimpleIndexVAO do not work as there is an issue setting the data, this is currently being investigated.
